# LeetCode

This repository contains my solutions to the problems in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).

## Structure

All of the source codes of solutions are put in `problems` folder, every solution has one corresponding C++ class, which is named after the problem. Each class is defined in one header file (`*.h`) and implemented in one source file (`*.cpp`), both of them are named after the problem, too.

There are at least two functions in each class:
- `solution`: My solution to this problem (In most cases it's not the best).
- `test`: A static function, including at least one test case, call it to check the correctness of the solution.

And one possible function:
- `recommended`: Recommended solution provided by LeetCode, existing if my solution is not the best.

Every time I start to consider the solution to a new problem, I just need to change some codes in `main.cpp`, ain't it convenient?

## Problems

Here are the problems that I have solved:

1. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)
2. [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)
3. To be continued...

Remember (to myself):
- It's never ever too late
- It's okay to make mistakes
